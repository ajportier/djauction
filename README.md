djauction
=========

A Django based web portal for managing auctions

djauction and the enclosed auction_manager application are intended for the management of small auction events.
The system describes participants in the auction, including their contact information, the items they brought to
be bid upon, and what they won. The system has logic to "check out" a participant, identifying how much money they
owe for their goods, and sharing contact information for donor and winner to exchange what was won. Participants and
items can be associated with auction events and updated as necessary, so if the same people participate in multiple
auction events, their details and purchase histories are saved.

This project was designed to meet the needs of an annual church auction, and for the author to experiment with Django
design strategies. May contain branding that any adopter would need to clean up.
